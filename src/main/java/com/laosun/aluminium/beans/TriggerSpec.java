 * One trigger rule from {@code resources/characters/<cid>.json} (P8-7):
 * "on &lt;event&gt;, when &lt;conditions&gt;, do &lt;effects&gt;".
 *
 * <p>This is the unit that replaces a `XxxTalent.java` class. The engine only interprets it --
 * it never learns which character it belongs to, which is the whole point of the P8-0 three-way
 * split.
 *
 * <p>⚠ Read the conditions as follows: the owning character is called <b>self</b> in
 * {@link #when}; the unit that caused the event is <b>actor</b>. So
 * {@code "when": ["actor != self"]} means "someone else on my side acted" -- which is how
 * Robin's "after an ally attacks" talent is expressed.
